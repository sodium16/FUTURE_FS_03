## üìñ About the Project

This project reimagines the Boat Lifestyle digital presence with a focus on a clean, modern UI/UX and dynamic content management. The original brand's "marine" theme was pivoted to a broader, more authentic "lifestyle audio" vibe, targeting a young, active audience.

The entire frontend is built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, while the backend is a headless CMS that provides all content‚Äîfrom products to homepage sections‚Äîvia a REST API.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Fully Responsive Design:** Optimized for a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* **Dynamic Content:** All products and most homepage content are managed via a headless CMS.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with reusable React components for consistency and maintainability.
* **Dynamic Pages:** Product category pages are generated dynamically based on the URL.
* **Static Pages:** Simple, fast-loading static pages for content like "Contact" and "Privacy Policy".
* **AI-Assisted Design:** Initial branding concepts, color palettes, and layouts were brainstormed using AI tools like Adobe Firefly and Durable.
